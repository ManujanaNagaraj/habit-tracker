🚀 **Excited to share my latest project: The Habit Tracker!** 🎯

We all know how hard it is to build new habits and actually stick to them. To solve this for myself, I decided to build a clean, interactive, and persistent **Habit Tracker** web application from scratch.

**💡 The Problem:**
Most habit trackers are either too complex or require paid subscriptions. I wanted something minimal, fast, and completely under my control.

**✨ Key Features:**
✅ **Weekly Grid System:** Track daily progress (Mon-Sun) with instant updates.
✅ **Smart Analytics:** Real-time weekly percentage calculation.
✅ **Monthly Dashboard:** A dynamic donut chart to visualize completed vs. missed tasks.
✅ **Data Persistence:** Uses SQLite to save habits and logs automatically, so progress is never lost.
✅ **Responsive UI:** A modern, clean design that works on any device.

**🛠️ Tech Stack:**
*   **Backend:** Python 🐍 & Flask
*   **Frontend:** HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (Vanilla) & Chart.js
*   **Database:** SQLite

It was a great experience connecting the frontend dynamic logic with a robust Python backend. I learned a lot about REST APIs, DOM manipulation, and database schema design!
